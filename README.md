# VU University


#### This website is built with `React` `React-router` `React bootstrap` `Node JS` `Express JS` `MongoDB atlas`.

- This website applies to a university admin dashboard.
- Three routes have been declared here. The first route is used as a course list, the second route as a student list, and the third route as a course add.
- The main function of this webpage is to add courses and add and delete courses. Which is being done with the help of a backend server. Again, student lists are created with a fake API that provides students with information based on their aptitude course.
